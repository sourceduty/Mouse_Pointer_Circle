### Applicable for Patent

The "Mouse_Pointer_Circle" project, developed by Sourceduty, demonstrates a unique functionality and originality that could make it a candidate for patent protection. While the copyright notice ("Copyright (C) 2023, Sourceduty - All Rights Reserved") ensures protection of the softwareâ€™s specific code and expression, patent protection could extend to the underlying inventive concepts or processes if they are novel, non-obvious, and useful. A patent would safeguard the functional aspects of the project, such as the innovative way it implements or interacts with mouse pointer behavior, providing broader and more comprehensive protection than copyright alone.

Patent protection would not only secure the exclusive rights to the inventive aspects of the project but also prevent competitors from creating and selling similar solutions that replicate the functionality, even if implemented differently. Given its originality, pursuing a patent could increase the project's value, offering legal grounds to license the functionality to others or enforce exclusivity in the marketplace. Combining copyright and patent protections would create a robust legal framework to secure both the software's creative and functional dimensions.
